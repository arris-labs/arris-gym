# C1 census and slice

`census.json` is `arris-gym census --corpus benchcad` run on BenchCAD
`code_gen` at revision `5919f578ab09ec283603a082fab07c7639ab56eb`; `slice.txt`
lists the 300 stems of the C1 slice (the first 3 ranked families with at
least 100 programs, the first 100 stems of each). Both hold counts and
stems: no program text. Digest of the census:
`043db6d912c7b77e4b0bc570b9160b2153286279f11a69ceccc57a63193d13ee`
(two runs equal).

## Result

- 17,900 programs: 17,900 parsed, 0 unparsable (none to list).
- 106 families. Every program ends in `show_object(result)`.
- No call has the receiver `?`: every call has a known root. Foreign calls
  (not ranked): `builtin.show_object` only.
- The slice's families, in rank order: `phone_stand` (192 programs; 6 calls,
  0 selector strings), `venturi_tube` (191; 6/0), `lobed_knob` (168; 7/0).
